  - gio
  - libxfce4ui
  Now it should build fine on modern systems again.
  Work done by Jan Rękorajski <baggins@pld-linux.org> and Skunnyk
  <skunnyk@archlinux.fr> -- Thanks!
- New icon by Simon Steinbeiß <simon.steinbeiss@gmail.com>
- Bugfixes, with some help of Christoph Wickert, Samuli Suominen, and
  Lionel Le Folgoc.
- Hide file browser and toolbar by default (it may be removed in future
  versions).

xfburn 0.4.3 (2010-02-12)
============-------------

- Fall back gracefully to use libburn when compiled with HAL support but 
  when the HAL daemon is not running.
- Again show the volume name in the burn dialog if it has the default value
- By default let libburn autodetect the write mode
- Fix a crash after burning is complete
- Fix a crash when adding files to a composition which was non-empty
- Don't ask unlimited number of times if a disc should get blanked
- Always check for mounted discs before using the drive

xfburn 0.4.2 (2009-07-23)
============-------------

- Internal updates in preparation for better handling of disc detection
- Handle drag and drop of filenames with spaces from nautilus (closes #4992)
- Insert dragged file dropped on top of another file instead of crashing
  (closes #5299)
- Properly detect the available space on an audio CD (closes #5302)

- Resample audio files with gstreamer if necessary (closes #5304)

xfburn 0.4.1 (2009-02-25)

  Thunar (and other file managers). Otherwise gtk complains (and potentially
  causes errors).
- Adding directories to a composition from within xfburn works again.
- Bump libburn version requirement to 0.5.6, since earlier versions might
  trigger a crash in libburn's fifo code. Version 0.4.2 or later will work,
  aside from this problem.
- Correctly detect some burners for which HAL reported unexpected values.
- Fall back to libburn-based burner detection if HAL does not find any.
- A man page is now included.

  work, p0llux!

- Allow adding hidden files and devices to the composition through the
  command line (they are not shown in the file selector)
- Add an entry to Thunar's sendto menu for adding to a data composition
  (thanks Mike Massonnet)
- Add directories to a data composition with the correct timestamp 
  (thanks JR Oldroyd for discovering this)
- Stop button works now
- Drag and drop into an audio composition now adds files in the correct order
- Check that the size of the burn run actually fits on the inserted disc
- Internal and string improvements

xfburn 0.3.91 (2008-11-03)
=============------------

- Use gstreamer to decompress any supported audio files to burn an audio CD ("gst" transcoder)
  NOTE: support for this is new, and not too unlikely to have some bugs ;-)
- Burn audio CDs from uncompressed CD audio .wav files ("basic" transcoder)
- Allow drags and drop from file managers like Thunar (text/uri-list target)

  window

xfburn 0.3.1 (2008-07-10)
============-------------

  debug is enabled, or otherwise some info on the burner that was used.
- Use fifo buffering, default is 4MB, adjustable in the preferences
