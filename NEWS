  WARNING: my dvd test burn failed if a speed was set!! CD was ok though.

  Use "Max" as speed if that is the case for you to get the old behavior,
  and _please_ report this as a bug! Please include the console output if
  debug is enabled, or otherwise some info on the burner that was used.
- Use fifo buffering, default is 4MB, adjustable in the preferences
